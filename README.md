__**KARE-KARE**__ Kare-kare is derived from "curry," which means a Philippines stew. It has beef's tripe, oxtail, or any kind of meat with different kinds of vegetables like eggplant, green beans, etc. It is made from thick savory peanut butter sauce and annatto powder that makes it more flavorful and with a partner of bagoong or "shrimp paste".
